Dockerstation is a better gui for docker, if you want it.

To get social venue to connect:
Run `docker-machine ip` and the output is the IP of virtualbox- container.
DynamicalSystems.ini:
Server = ip:${MMO_SERVER_PORT}
Mumble=ip:${MMO_MUMBLE_PORT}
Audio is blank.

Create a entry called docker to hold them, and set that as current environment.
You can use mumble for windows to test murmur and connected mumble bots
You don't have to. Docker-compose run will also tell you, just not with a gui.

Eventually, we'll have nginx handling the udp load balancing, and everything else to make it solidified. But for now, it'll just host the docs.
The procedure, will not change, even if the underlying parts do. Always docker-compose build, when downloading newest, docker-compose run to start it
If you ever just hate life and want to burn it all to the ground `docker-machine stop default && docket-machine rm default` will destroy the VM. Rinse,repeat.
This also applies for a separate computer on local network- docker-machine ip is NAT, so accessible on network. (edited)

<h6>
Download docker toolbox
`docker-compose build && docker-compose run`
`docker-machine ip`
</h6>
If you do not want docker to run in foreground, use `docker-compose start` instead of up.
